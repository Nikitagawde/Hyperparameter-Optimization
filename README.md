# Hyperparameter-Optimization
-Created a hyperparameter database to store the numerous hyperparameter values over several data sets and calculated the individual conditional expectations of every hyperparameter on the quality of the model /n
-Performed analysis to find the best and the worst hyperparameters among all runs, algorithms and leaderboard ranks of the hyperparameters of each model of every run /n
-Constructed views, functions and procedures to find importance of variables, accuracy of models, best models, average of evaluation matrices
